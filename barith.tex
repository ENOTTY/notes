\section{Variables, Conditionals, Booleans, \& Errors}

The $\Arith$ language is about as simple a programming language as
you're likely to find, although it served us well in demonstrating many
of the core ideas behind syntax and semantics.
%
As programmers, we like programming in rich, expressive languages, 
which $\Arith$ ain't.
%
But as we enrich languages, we must also enrich our models.
%
Let's look at a minimal increment to the $\Arith$ language and what it
entails for our models.
%
Let's add a new binary operator, $\Div$, which performs integer
division.
%
Let's add a new binary operator, $\Eq$, which determines if two
integers are equal.
%
Since an answer to the question ``are these two numbers equal?'' is
either a yes or a no, let's add a new kind of value, Booleans, to the
language to represent such answers.
%
Booleans are useful for conditionally selecting computations, let's
add a conditional form, $\If(e_1,e_2,e_3)$, which will select $e_2$
when $e_1$ evaluates to $\True$ and $e_3$ when it evaluates to
$\False$.  Finally, for good measure, let's throw in variables so that
programs run on given inputs.  We'll call this language $\Barith$ to
distinguish it from $\Arith$.

The syntax of $\Barith$ is straightfoward to define.  We add a couple
nullary constructors for Booleans, a binary constructor for equality
and for division, and a ternary constructor for conditionals.  For
variables, we assume there is an infinite, enumerable set of variable
names, $\Var$, and use lower-case, italic names to denote elements of
that set.  Two variables are considered ``the same'' if they are
spelled the same:

\[
\begin{array}{llcl}
\mathit{Var} & \mvar & = & \s{x}\ |\ \s{y}\ |\ \s{z}\ |\ \dots \\
\mathit{Bool} & \mbool & = & \True\ |\ \False\\
\Barith & e & = & \mvar\ |\ \mbool\ |\ \Eq(e,e)\ |\ \Div(e,e)\ |\ \If(e,e,e)\\
        &   & | & \mint\ |\ \Pred(e)\ |\ \Succ(e)\ |\ \Plus(e,e)\ |\ \Mult(e,e)
\end{array}
\]



Before delving into the details of the semantics, it's worth taking
time to ponder over a few $\Barith$ programs and think informally
about what they should mean:

\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item $\s{x}$
\item $\Eq(\False,7)$
\item $\Div(7,0)$
\item $\If(4,1,2)$
\item $\If(\False,\Div(7,0),3)$
\end{enumerate}

Let's take the first one.  What should $\s{x}$ mean?  Consider this
question in the context of a mathematical formula: $x^2+4$.  What does
$x$ mean here?  The answer is: it depends.  You can answer the
question without first giving a meaning to the variable.  So $x^2+4$
means $13$ when $x=3$ and it means $29$ when $x=5$.  The meaning of
the formula varies with the meaning of the variable.  The same should
be true for our programming language.

What about $\Eq(\False,7)$?  Here you could make different design
choices.  You might follow the JavaScript approach and produce false
since $\False$ is different than $7$.  Or maybe true because the
pointer representation of $7$ and $\False$ turn out to be the same.
Or maybe you return $42$, because why not?  Or you might do something
sensible and raise an error because a numerical operator was applied
to the wrong kind of argument.  Likewise for $\Div(7,0)$ and
$\If(4,1,2)$; the right thing is to signal an error.  But what does
that mean for the semantic model?

\subsection{Natural Semantics for Imprecise Errors}

Let's identify a set of \emph{values} and a set of \emph{answers}.
Values include integers and Booleans.  Answers include values and
errors:
\[
\begin{array}{llcl}
\mathit{Val} & \mval & = & \mbool\ |\ \mint\\
\mathit{Ans} & \mans & = & \mval\ |\ \merr\\
\mathit{Err} & \merr & = & \Err_\ell \text{ where $\ell$ is in some set}
\end{array}
\]
We'll assume there are an infinite number of different errors and
write subscripts to distinguish them ($\ell$ ranges over these subscripts).


Since evaluation now depends on an environment, the natural semantics
is modelled as a ternary relation $(\cdot \vdash \cdot \Downarrow
\cdot) \subseteq (\mathit{Var} \rightharpoonup \mathit{Val})\times
\Barith \times \mathit{Ans}$.  The relation includes an
\deftech{environment} which maps variables to values.  Environments,
ranged over by meta-variable $\menv$, are partial functions from
variables to environments and $\dom(\menv) = \{ \mvar\ |\ \menv(\mvar)
= \mval \text{ for some }\mval \}$.  Values are self
evaluating. Variables evaluate to the value given by the environment,
or an error if undefined:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\ }
          {\beval\menv\mval\mval}

\inferrule{\menv(\mvar) = \mval}
          {\beval\menv\mvar\mval}

\inferrule{\mvar \notin \dom(\menv)}
          {\beval\menv\mvar{\Err_{\mvar}}}
\end{mathpar}
Equality is defined as you might expect, producing true when its
arguments evaluate the same number, false when they evaluate to
different numbers, and an error when they evaluate to non-numbers:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mint \\ \beval\menv{\mexp_2}\moint \\ \mint = \moint}
          {\beval\menv{\Eq(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}\True}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mint \\ \beval\menv{\mexp_2}\moint \\ \mint \neq \moint}
          {\beval\menv{\Eq(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}\False}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mbool}
          {\beval\menv{\Eq(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\Err_{\Eq1}}}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_2}\mbool}
          {\beval\menv{\Eq(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\Err_{\Eq2}}}
\end{mathpar}
Division performs the integer division of its arguments when they
evaluate to numeric values and the denominator is non-zero; it
produces an error when the denominator is zero or either argument
evaluates to a non-numeric value:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mint
  \\ \beval\menv{\mexp_2}\moint
  \\ \moint \neq 0
  \\ k = \lfloor \mint / \moint \rfloor}
          {\beval\menv{\Div(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{k}}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mint
  \\ \beval\menv{\mexp_2}\moint
  \\ \moint = 0}
          {\beval\menv{\Div(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\Err_{\Div0}}}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mbool}
          {\beval\menv{\Div(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\Err_{\Div1}}}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_2}\mbool}
          {\beval\menv{\Div(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\Err_{\Div2}}}
\end{mathpar}
Conditionals select which value to produce based on the evaluation of
the test expression, and produce an error if the test produces a
non-Boolean value:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\beval\menv{e_1}\True \\
  \beval\menv{e_2}\mans}
          {\beval\menv{\If(e_1,e_2,e_3)}\mans}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{e_1}\False \\
  \beval\menv{e_3}\mans}
          {\beval\menv{\If(e_1,e_2,e_3)}\mans}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{e_1}\mint}
          {\beval\menv{\If(e_1,e_2,e_3)}{\Err_{\If}}}
\end{mathpar}
The remaining rules for $\Succ$, $\Pred$, $\Plus$, and $\Mult$ are
straightforward following the same pattern as above: when their
arguments evaluate to numbers, they do the obvious thing; when given non-numeric
arguments, they produce errors.

While the above rules take care of creating errors when they arise, no
rules have dealt with the propagation of errors.  For example, we
should expect $\Eq(\Div(3,0),4)$ to produce a divide by zero error,
although as it stands the semantics is undefined.  Adding the
following rules propagates errors from subexpressions in $\Eq$:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\merr}
          {\beval\menv{\Eq(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}\merr}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_2}\merr}
          {\beval\menv{\Eq(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}\merr}
\end{mathpar}
We need similar rules for all of the remaining syntactic constructors.
%% ,
%% with the exception of $\If$.  For $\If$, only the following rule is
%% added:
%% \begin{mathpar}
%% \inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\Err}
%%           {\beval\menv{\If(\mexp_1,\mexp_2,\mexp_3)}\Err}>
%% \end{mathpar}
%% Why?  (Hint: think about the last example $\Barith$ program you were
%% asked to ponder.)

\paragraph{Properties of the semantics:}
Now that the semantics is in place, let's step back and consider some
of its properties.  The addition of errors has significantly
complicated the formal development---we had to add a bunch of rules
for signal and propogating errors.  But dealing with errors and
establishing the meaning of errors is a crucial aspect of semantic
engineering.  Remember that a semantics is useful for definining
properties of programs, and one of the more useful properties is
``this program causes no errors.''  So to even talk about this, we
need to confront error behaviors in the semantics.

But beyond the additional rules, errors, at least as we have
formulated them, have also caused an important change to our
semantics.  Unlike in the error-free case of $\Arith$, our evaluation
relation is no longer a function.  To see this, consider
$\Eq(\Div(3,0),\False)$.  This expression either produces a divide by
zero error ($\Err_{\Div0}$), or a type error ($\Err_\If$) for giving a
Boolean to $\Eq$.  This is concerning for anyone who wants to write an
interpreter for, or reason about, $\Barith$ programs.  If we were
writing an interpreter, we should wonder ``what should it produce for
$\Eq(\Div(3,0),\False)$?''  One answer is an interpreter only has to
find \emph{some} answer that is consistent with the semantics; so if
$\syntax{eval}\; \menv\; \mexp = \mval$, then $\beval\menv\mexp\mval$,
but the reverse direction would not hold (the interpreter then, is an
abstraction of the natural semantics).  Many languages take this
approach.  Haskell for example, uses an imprecise exception
semantics\footnote{\url{http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/imprecise-exn.htm}},
basically following the outline we have above.  Other languages choose
to \emph{specify} which error should be signalled by determinizing the
language and restoring the functional nature of evaluation.

\subsection{Natural Semantics for Precise Errors}

The thing leading to the observed non-determinism of the evaluator is
the overlap in hypothesis in the different inference rules.  Consider the error
propogation rules for $\Eq$.  It's possible that
$\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mbool$ \emph{and}
$\beval\menv{\mexp_2}{\mbool'}$, thus either rule could apply leading
to distinct answers.  By grade school analogy, it's as if the answer
to a basic algebra problem depended on the order in which you
simplified terms.  A solution then is to specify more rigorously the
order in which subexpressions should be evaluated, which can be
achieved by making the hypotheses of the inference rules
non-overlapping.  For example, if we want to evaluate $\Eq$
expressions left-to-right, we can use the following rules for error
generation and propogation:

\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mbool \\
           \beval\menv{\mexp_2}\mval}
          {\beval\menv{\Eq(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\Err_{\Eq1}}}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mint \\
           \beval\menv{\mexp_2}\mbool }
          {\beval\menv{\Eq(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\Err_{\Eq2}}}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\merr}
          {\beval\menv{\If(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}\merr}

\inferrule{\beval\menv{\mexp_1}\mval \\
           \beval\menv{\mexp_2}\merr}
          {\beval\menv{\If(\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}\merr}
\end{mathpar}

\begin{exercise}
Implement an interpreter for the imprecise error semantics as a
function in OCaml.  Your interpreter is free to produce any answer
that is consistent with the semantics.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{ex:determ}
Following the idea above, develop an alternative semantics for
$\Barith$ that is deterministic, i.e.  the evaluation relation is a
function.  Prove that it is in fact a function.  Implement this
function in OCaml.  Is this function a satisfying solution to the
previous problem?
\end{exercise}


\subsection{A Consistent Syntactic Theory}

Now that we've seen the complications errors introduce in the setting
of natural semantics, let's look at the same development using
reduction semantics.

First, we will need to include $\Err$s in the syntax of $\Barith$
programs to model reduction:
\[
\begin{array}{llcl}
\mathit{Exp} & \mexp & = & \dots\ |\ \merr
\end{array}
\]
With this in place, many of the axioms are straightforward:
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{\menv(\mvar) = \mval}
            {\breduce\menv\mvar\mval}

  \inferrule{\mvar \notin \dom(\menv)}
            {\breduce\menv\mvar{\Err_\mvar}}

  \inferrule{i=j}
            {\breduce\menv{\Eq(i,j)}\True}

  \inferrule{i\neq j}
            {\breduce\menv{\Eq(i,j)}\False}

  \inferrule{j\neq 0 \\ k = \lfloor i/j \rfloor}
            {\breduce\menv{\Div(i,j)}{k}}

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Div(i,0)}{\Err_{\Div0}}}

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\If(\True,\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\mexp_1}}

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\If(\False,\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\mexp_2}}

\end{mathpar}
We also need rules for creating type errors.  Some are straightforward,
such as branching on an integer instead of a Boolean:
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\If(i,\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\Err_\If}}
\end{mathpar}
But we would be wrong to add the following axioms for $\Eq$ and
$\Div$:
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Eq(\mbool,\mexp)}{\Err_{\Eq1}}}

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Eq(\mexp,\mbool)}{\Err_{\Eq2}}}           

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Div(\mbool,\mexp)}{\Err_{\Div1}}}

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Div(\mexp,\mbool)}{\Err_{\Div2}}}           
\end{mathpar}
The problem with these rules is they would immediately make the
syntactic theory inconsistent and identify all errors as equal.  For
example, we can have $\breduce\relax{\Eq(\Err_1,\Err_2)}{\Err_1}$ and
$\breduce\relax{\Eq(\Err_1,\Err_2)}{\Err_2}$, which induces the
equivalence $\vdash\Err_1 =_\breducename \Err_2$.  We also have to be
careful with how errors are propagated.  At first glance, you might
think to propagate errors past each of the syntactic constructors.  So
for example, you might have the following propagation rules for $\Eq$,
and similar rules for all the other constructors:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\ }
          {\breduce\menv{\Eq(\merr,\mexp)}{\merr}}

\inferrule{\ }
          {\breduce\menv{\Eq(\mexp,\merr)}{\merr}}
\end{mathpar}
But this also causes inconsistency.  Moreover, any two programs which
contain or may reduce to errors would be equated in the theory.
That's not a useful equational theory.

Instead, we want to limit the $\breducename$ relation in the following
way.  In order for a type error to be created, the subexpressions must
be values:
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Eq(\mbool,\mval)}{\Err_{\Eq1}}}

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Eq(\mbool,\mval)}{\Err_{\Eq2}}}           

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Div(\mbool,\mval)}{\Err_{\Div1}}}

  \inferrule{\ }
            {\breduce\menv{\Div(\mval,\mbool)}{\Err_{\Div2}}}
\end{mathpar}
Likewise, when propagating errors, we only allow propagation
when subexpressions to the left of the error are values:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\ }
          {\breduce\menv{\Eq(\merr,\mexp)}{\merr}}

\inferrule{\ }
          {\breduce\menv{\Eq(\mval,\merr)}{\merr}}
\end{mathpar}
The remaining rules for $\Pred$, $\Succ$, $\Div$, $\Plus$, and $\Mult$
are similar.  One notable exception is $\If$.  We only allow errors to
propagate past an $\If$ if the error occurs in the test position:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\ }
          {\breduce\menv{\If(\merr,\mexp_1,\mexp_2)}{\merr}}
\end{mathpar}




We can now define $\bstepname$ as the compatible closure of
$\breducename$ over the grammar of $\Barith$ expressions,
$\bmultistepname$ as the reflexive transitive closure of $\bstepname$,
and $=_\breducename$ as the symmetric closure of $\bmultistepname$.

Note that this theory allows us to reduce inside of $\If$ expressions,
but if an error occurs, we cannot propogate it out until the test
expression produces a value and the $\If$ is reduced to the consequent
or alternative based on it.

\begin{exercise}[Consistency]
Prove if $\menv \vdash \mexp =_\breducename \mans \mbox{ and } \menv
\vdash \mexp =_\breducename \mans'$, then $\mans = \mans'$.
\end{exercise}



\subsection{Standard Reduction}

The approach of using evaluation contexts to specify canonical
reductions scales up to more complicated languages such as $\Barith$.
To define a standard reduction semantics for $\Barith$, the notion of
evaluation contexts includes everything from $\Arith$, plus:
\[
\begin{array}{llcl}
\mathit{EvalContext} & \mectx & = & \dots \\
                 &       & | & \Eq(\mectx,\mexp)\ |\ \Eq(\mval,\mectx)\\
                 &       & | & \Div(\mectx,\mexp)\ |\ \Div(\mval,\mectx)\\
                 &       & | & \If(\mectx,\mexp,\mexp)
\end{array}
\]
%% Note that only the test position of an $\If$ expression is an
%% evaluation context. This forces $\If$ to first evaluate the test
%% before evaluating the consequent or alternative, which prevents, for
%% example, $\If(\False,\Err_{\Div0},4)$ from producing an error.

The standard reduction relation is defined as:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\breduce\menv\mexp{\mexp'}}
          {\bstdstep\menv{\plug\mectx\mexp}{\plug\mectx{\mexp'}}}
\end{mathpar}


\begin{exercise}[Standardization]\label{ex:standardization}
Prove $\bstdmultistep\menv\mexp\mans \iff \bmultistep\menv\mexp\mans$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Implement the standard reduction relation as a function in OCaml.
Implement an interpreter for $\Barith$ by iterating the standard
reduction relation until an answer is produced.
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Discarding the Context}

When introducing contexts in section~\ref{sec:context} that
formulating reductions explicitly in terms of contexts gives us
expressive power to write new kinds of reductions that are difficult
to do without a context.

To see an example, consider how programs produce errors
in our reduction semantics.  We have some expression, say
$\Plus(3,\Mult(2,\Div(5,0)))$, which introduces an error on the next
step and then step by step propagates the error outward until it is
the final answer:
\begin{mathpar}
\bclosedstep{\bclosedstep{\bclosedstep{\Plus(3,\Mult(2,\Div(5,0)))}{\Plus(3,\Mult(2,\Err_{\Div0}))}}
  {\Plus(3,\Err_{\Div0})}}
            {\Err_{\Div0}}
\end{mathpar}
Achieving this step-by-step bubbling up of errors tedious because it
required a bunch of reduction axioms of the form
$\Mult(\mval,\Err_\ell)\;\breducename\;\Err_\ell$.
%
We can avoid the propagating reductions and intermediate steps in the
standardized semantics.  Let $\breducename'$ be $\breducename$ without
any error propagation rules.  Then standard reduction can be defined
by the following two inference rules:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule{\menv\vdash\mexp\;\breducename'\;{\mexp'}}
          {\bstdstep\menv{\plug\mectx\mexp}{\plug\mectx{\mexp'}}}

\inferrule{\ }
          {\bstdstep\menv{\plug\mectx{\Err_\ell}}{\Err_\ell}}
\end{mathpar}
The example now immediately jumps to the final error state:
\begin{mathpar}
\bstdstep\menv{\Plus(3,\Mult(2,\Err_{\Div0}))}
              {\Err_{\Div0}}
\end{mathpar}


\begin{exercise}
Reprove the standardization theorem (exercise~\ref{ex:standardization})
for this alternative standard reduction relation.
\end{exercise}
